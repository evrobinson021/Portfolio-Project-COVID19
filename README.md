# COVID-19 Global Dashboard

An interactive data visualisation project, analysing global COVID-19 trends using **SQL** for data preparation and **Tableau** for dashboard design. This project focuses on exploring large-scale, real-world data and communicating insights clearly through effective visual storytelling.

## Project Overview

This dashboard answers key analytical questions, including:

- What are the global totals for COVID-19 cases and deaths?
- How does the death toll vary across continents?
- What percentage of each country’s population has been infected?
- How do case and death trends change over time?

The aim of this project is to demonstrate my ability to clean, aggregate, and analyse complex datasets, then present findings in a clear and accessible way for the reader.

## Dashboard Features

- Global KPIs - Total cases, total deaths, and overall death percentage.

- Total Deaths per Continent - A bar chart highlighting regional differences in COVID-19 mortality.

- Percent of Population Infected (World Map) - A thematic map visualising infection rates by country.

- Maximum Cases vs Maximum Deaths Over Time - A combined bar and line chart comparing monthly peaks in cases and deaths.

## Key Insights

- North and South America recorded the highest total death counts compared to other continents.
- Infection rates vary significantly between countries, even within the same region.
- Peaks in reported cases do not always align with peaks in deaths, highlighting delays in reporting and differences in healthcare impact.

## Tools & Technologies

- SQL – data cleaning, joins, aggregations, and calculations

- Tableau – dashboard creation, calculated fields, KPIs, and interactive visualisations

- Public COVID-19 Dataset – global cases, deaths, and population data

## Data Preparation

The dataset required cleaning and transformation before analysis, including:

- Handling missing and inconsistent values
- Correcting data types for numerical calculations
- Aggregating data at country, continent, and global levels
- Creating calculated fields for death percentages and infection rates

## Purpose of This Project

This project was created as part of my data analytics portfolio to demonstrate:

1. Practical SQL skills using a large, real-world dataset
2. Ability to design clear and effective Tableau dashboards
3. Data storytelling and insight communication

## Future Improvements

Future enhancements could include adding interactive filters for date ranges and continents, incorporating vaccination and testing data for deeper analysis, and using annotations to highlight major global events and key trend changes.

## About Me

I’m an aspiring data analyst with a strong interest in SQL and data visualisation. This project represents a step up in complexity from my earlier work and demonstrates my ability to work with real-world datasets at scale.
